Nowadays, more and more people & organizations are paying attention to civic tech, seeing potential in the intersection between civics & all things digital. However, 'civic tech' is tough to define - it can mean a lot of different things to different people of different backgrounds. *That* is exciting!

####This Civic Tech Watercooler will be a collaborative blogging experiment, of sorts, with the goal of encouraging and recording more diverse perspectives & stories in civic tech.

I don’t really know what this will look like or how it will play out, but hey - let’s give it a shot.

Have **thoughts** on civics? on access? on the distribution of power in society?  
Have **stories** of writing FOIA requests? of breaking down bureaucracy? of learning something new?  
Have **expertise** in community organizing? in design? in wrangling data?

Shoot me an email (cathyd125@gmail.com) & let’s share some of the awesome things you keep in your brain!
